# HBnB Project – Part 2  
## Business Logic & API Implementation

This part of the **HBnB Project** focuses on implementing the core functionality of the application using **Python**, **Flask**, and **flask-restx**.

Based on the architecture designed in Part 1, we build the:

- **Business Logic Layer** (models and relationships)
- **Presentation Layer** (RESTful API endpoints)

The application supports the management of:

- Users  
- Places  
- Reviews  
- Amenities  

CRUD operations are implemented for each entity, and related data (such as place owner and amenities) is properly serialized in API responses.

At this stage, the project focuses only on core functionality.  
Authentication and role-based access control will be implemented in **Part 3**.
